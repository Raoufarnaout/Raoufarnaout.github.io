            <h2>B. Student-Written Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of compounds consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands to form one, two, or three dimensional structures. This article reviews recent advancements in synthesizing these porous materials, specifically focusing on how the bond strength between the metal nodes and the organic linkers determines the material's thermal and chemical stability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The study highlights that by tweaking the geometry and electronic properties of these linkers, scientists can create MOFs that remain stable under harsh conditions. The conclusion suggests that these highly tunable structures are the future of targeted drug delivery, as their porous cages can safely transport medicine through the body and release it only when specific structural bonds are broken at the target site.

            <p>This research is a perfect application of <strong>Intermolecular Forces (IMFs)</strong> and <strong>Molecular Geometry</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Intramolecular vs. Intermolecular</h3>
                <p>The stability of the MOF relies on the strength of the <em>coordination covalent bonds</em> (intramolecular) between the metal cation and the organic linker. However, the ability of the MOF to hold a drug molecule relies on <em>London Dispersion Forces</em> and <em>Dipole-Dipole interactions</em> (intermolecular) inside the porous cage.</p>

                <h3>Shape and Properties</h3>
                <p>The article demonstrates that the physical property of the material (porosity/surface area) is directly determined by its chemical structure. By changing the length of the organic linker, chemists change the size of the pores, allowing them to control exactly what molecules fit inside.</p>

            <h2>D. Critical Thinking Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>How could this chemistry be improved or applied differently in the future?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Currently, many MOFs rely on transition metals that can be toxic if the framework degrades prematurely in the body. Future chemistry could focus on using biocompatible metals like calcium or magnesium (Group 2 elements) as the nodes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, if we can engineer the linker molecules to be sensitive to pH changes, we could create smart materials that only disassemble and release their drug payload in the acidic environment of a tumor, minimizing side effects for cancer patients.
