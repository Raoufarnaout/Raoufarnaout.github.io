            <h2>B. Student-Written Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Plastic pollution is one of the world's most pressing environmental crises, largely because traditional petroleum based plastics possess strong carbon carbon bonds that do not break down easily. This article introduces a new bioplastic based on Polylactic Acid (PLA) that has been modified with a layered nanostructure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike standard PLA, which requires industrial composting heat to degrade, this new material can break down in water at room temperature. The study finds that by manipulating the polymer chains to be more accessible to water, the material maintains strength while in use but degrades rapidly when submerged in marine environments, potentially solving the ocean plastic accumulation problem.

                <h3>Esters and Hydrolysis</h3>
                <p>PLA is a polyester formed by condensation polymerization involving carboxylic acid and alcohol groups. The degradation process described is <strong>hydrolysis</strong>, where water molecules attack the ester linkage, breaking the polymer chain back into small monomers.</p>

            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Structure-Property Relationships</h3>
                <p>In class, we studied how cross linking and chain length affect polymer strength. This research shows that by rearranging the molecular arrangement, scientists can expose the ester bonds to water more effectively, speeding up the chemical breakdown without changing the fundamental organic formula.</p>

            <h2>D. Critical Thinking Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>What new questions does this research raise?</strong></p>
            <p>
                If this plastic degrades in water at room temperature, how do we prevent it from degrading prematurely if it holds liquid products like a water bottle or soda? This raises questions about chemical coatings or hydrophobic layers that might be needed to protect the container during use. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Are the breakdown products monomers actually safe for marine life, or does the rapid increase in lactic acid concentration locally affect the pH of the water surrounding the degrading waste?
