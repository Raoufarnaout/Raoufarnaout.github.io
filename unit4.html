            <h2>B. Student Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The ocean has long acted as a "carbon sink," absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This article discusses new data from 2025 indicating that we have surpassed a critical threshold for ocean acidity. The study focuses on the "aragonite saturation state," a measure of carbonate ion availability which marine organisms need to build shells.
            </p>
            <p>
                The findings show that as dissolved $CO_2$ increases, the equilibrium shifts to effectively dissolve the shells of organisms like oysters and plankton. The conclusion is alarming: the buffering capacity of the ocean is being overwhelmed, threatening the foundation of the global marine food web.

            <p>This is a real-world tragedy explained by <strong>Le Chatelier’s Principle</strong> and <strong>Acid-Base Equilibrium</strong>.</p>
            
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>The Equilibrium System</h3>
                <p>When $CO_2$ dissolves in water, it establishes the following equilibrium:</p>
                <p>$$CO_2 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + HCO_3^-$$</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Le Chatelier’s Shift & Common Ion Effect</h3>
                <p>As humans emit more $CO_2$ (a stress on the system), the equilibrium shifts right to consume it, producing more $H^+$ ions. This lowers the pH (acidification).</p>
                <p>The increased $H^+$ reacts with carbonate ions ($CO_3^{2-}$), which are needed by shell-building creatures:</p>
                <p>$$Ca^{2+} + CO_3^{2-} \rightleftharpoons CaCO_3$$</p>
                <p>By consuming the carbonate to form bicarbonate, the chemistry forces the shell-formation equilibrium to shift left, effectively causing shells to dissolve.</p>

            <h2>D. Critical Thinking: Assumptions</h2>
            <p><strong>What assumptions or limitations exist in the science presented?</strong></p>
            <p>
                The study assumes a global average for acidification, but ocean chemistry is not uniform. Local conditions (temperature, currents, biological activity) can create "micro-climates" of acidity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A limitation of focusing solely on the "aragonite saturation state" is that it might not account for the biological adaptation of certain species. Some organisms might have biological mechanisms to regulate their internal pH despite the external environment. Future research needs to differentiate between the <em>chemical</em> equilibrium of the water and the <em>biological</em> resilience of the species living in it.
