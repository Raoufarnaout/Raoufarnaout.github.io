            <h2>B. Student-Written Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                The ocean has acted as a carbon sink for a long time, absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This article discusses new data from 2025 indicating that we have surpassed a critical threshold for ocean acidity. The study focuses on the aragonite saturation state, a measure of carbonate ion availability which marine organisms need to build shells.
            </p>
            <p>
                The findings show that as dissolved $CO_2$ increases, the equilibrium shifts to effectively dissolve the shells of organisms like oysters and plankton. The conclusion is alarming, the buffering capacity of the ocean is being overwhelmed which is threatening the foundation of the global marine food web.

                <h3>The Equilibrium System</h3>
                <p>When $CO_2$ dissolves in water, it establishes the following equilibrium:</p>
                <p>$$CO_2 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + HCO_3^-$$</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Le Chatelier’s Shift & The Common Ion Effect</h3>
                <p>As humans emit more $CO_2$, a stress on the system, the equilibrium shifts right to consume it, producing more $H^+$ ions. This lowers the pH (acidification).</p>
                <p>The increased $H^+$ reacts with carbonate ions ($CO_3^{2-}$), which are needed by shell building creatures:</p>
                <p>$$Ca^{2+} + CO_3^{2-} \rightleftharpoons CaCO_3$$</p>
                <p>By consuming the carbonate to form bicarbonate, the chemistry forces the shell formation equilibrium to shift left, effectively causing shells to dissolve.</p>

            <h2>D. Critical Thinking Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>What assumptions or limitations exist in the science presented?</strong></p>
            <p>
                The study assumes a global average for acidification, but ocean chemistry is not uniform. Local conditions, temperature, currents, and biological activity can create micro climates of acidity. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A limitation of focusing solely on the aragonite saturation state is that it might not account for the biological adaptation of certain species. Some organisms might have biological mechanisms to regulate their internal pH despite the external environment. Future research needs to differentiate between the chemical equilibrium of the water and the biological resilience of the species living in it.
